                            The heart of our 'Wednesday of Wonders' program pulsates with three

                            worship, the word, and miracles. Each component weaves together to create
                            an environment where the supernatural becomes natural, where the miraculous
                            becomes an everyday occurrence. In this sacred space, we fervently worship,
                            delve into the profound teachings
                            of the Word, and witness awe-inspiring miracles unfold before our eyes.
