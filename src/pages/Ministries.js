              Wednesday Of wonders

            <h3>
              At our 'Wednesday of Wonders' program, participants embark on a
              transformative journey where the divine presence and the
              remarkable power of the Holy Spirit are experienced in a truly
              extraordinary manner. These gatherings are divinely appointed,
              marked by the abundant grace of salvation, miraculous healings,
              liberating deliverances, and the palpable presence of the Holy
              Spirit..
              <p className="py-4">
                The heart of our 'Wednesday of Wonders' program pulsates with
                three pillars: worship, the word, and miracles. Each component
                weaves together to create an environment where the supernatural
                becomes natural, where the miraculous becomes an everyday
                occurrence. In this sacred space, we fervently worship, delve
                into the profound teachings of the Word, and witness
                awe-inspiring miracles unfold before our eyes.
